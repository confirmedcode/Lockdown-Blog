#### Scaling Privacy to the Next 10 Million Users
<!--more-->

Hey— it’s Johnny and Rahul, co-founders of Lockdown Privacy.

We’re pleased to announce that Lockdown Privacy has been acquired by Appex Group, a privacy-conscious mobile development group fully owned and operated by passionate technologists and engineers. Appex is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and is led by open source veterans with extensive background in security. The Appex team was immediately attracted to Lockdown's industry-leading transparency, and saw that by prioritizing trust through transparency, Lockdown was able to grow organically to over a million users, instead of relying on invasive ads or marketing - a win for both user privacy and for Lockdown.

Going forward, not only is the Appex team committed to operating Lockdown as open source, but they're also heavily investing in building out new privacy features and performance enhancements, such as a next-generation tracker-blocking engine that’s exponentially more efficient - updates that our two-person team didn't previously have the resources for.

For us as founders, we're happy that Lockdown's new operators are folks who believe in the importance of privacy, and who arguably have much deeper experience with open source than us. Of course, actions speak louder than words, so this month, Appex is completing Lockdown's fifth audit by independent security and privacy experts - the update will be posted and announced in the next few weeks on OpenAudit.

We look forward to continuing to work with Appex as strategic advisors - and if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, you can reach Johnny at [johnny@lockdownprivacy.com](mailto:johnny@lockdownprivacy.com), and the Appex team at [team@lockdownprivacy.com](mailto:team@lockdownprivacy.com).

Best,

Appex & Lockdown Privacy
